# Campus Cycle

Campus Cycle is a localized e-commerce platform designed specifically for college students to buy and sell used goods and furniture. This platform addresses the needs of college students who frequently move, offering an affordable, sustainable, and community-driven solution.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into separate directories for the frontend and backend:

- The `frontend` directory contains the client-side code built with Vue.js, including components for different views such as the home page, product detail page, user profile, and forms for adding and editing listings.
- The `backend` directory contains the server-side code built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It includes the server setup, database connection, middleware, models, and API routes for handling various operations like user authentication, listing management, search functionality, and admin-specific tasks.

The project also includes Docker configurations for containerizing the frontend and backend applications, as well as Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster.
